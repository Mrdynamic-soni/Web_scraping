people hear AI often think sentient robots magic boxes . AI today much mundane simple�but doesn�t mean it�s powerful . Another misconception high-profile research projects applied directly business situation . AI done right create extreme return investments ( ROIs ) �for instance automation precise prediction . take thought , time , proper implementation . seen success value generated AI projects increased grounded understanding expectation technology deliver C-suite down.�Artificial Intelligence ( AI ) science set computational technologies inspired by�but typically operate quite differently from�the ways people use nervous systems bodies sense , learn , reason take action.�3 Lately big rise day-to-day use machines powered AI . machines wired using cross-disciplinary approaches based mathematics , computer science , statistics , psychology , more.4 Virtual assistants becoming common , web shops predict purchases , many companies make use chatbots customer service many companies use algorithms detect fraud.AI Deep Learning technology employed office entry systems bring proper time tracking employee . system tries learn person image processing technology whose data feed forwarded deep learning model Deep learning isn�t algorithm per se , rather family algorithms implements deep networks ( many layers ) . networks deep new methods computation , graphics processing units ( GPUs ) , required train , addition clusters compute nodes . using deep learning take detect employee using face person recognition scan login , logout timing recorded . Using AI system even identify employee�s entry time , working hours , non-working hours tracking movement employee office system predict report HR salary employee based working hours . system take feed CCTV track movements employees system capable recognizing person even he/she masked pandemic situation taking iris scan . system installed inside office , following benefits : several countries , regulations insist employer must keep documents available demonstrate working hours performed employee . event control labor inspectorate dispute employee , employer must able explain justify working hours company . made easy system tracking employee movementsThis monitoring user connection times detect suspicious access times . event compromised credentials used log 3 a.m. Saturday , notification access could alert team attack possibly underway.To manage react employees� attendance , overtime thresholds , productivity , suspicious access times , system records stores detailed interactive reporting users� connection times . records allow better manage users� connection times provide accurate , detailed data required management.4 ) want avoid paying overtime , make sure employees respect certain working time quotas even avoid suspicious access . system alert HR officer employee�s office time accordingly take action.5 ) Last least reduces human resource needs keep track records sending report HR HR officials check report system reduce times human resource needsWith use AI Deep Learning technologies , automate routines stuff functionality humans need resources keep track thereby reducing time spent manual data entry works rather companies think making position high competitive world .
